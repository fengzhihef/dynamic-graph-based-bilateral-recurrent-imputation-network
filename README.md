# Dynamic Graph-Based Bilateral Recurrent Imputation Network for Multivariate Time Series
This repository contains the code for a dynamic graph-based method for multivariate time series imputation. This method aims to address the imputation of missing values in any multivariate time series without requiring a predefined graph structure. It flexibly learns the relationships between variables by dynamically constructing graph structures.
## Acknowledgement
This network is primarily implemented based on the graph recurrent imputation network (GRIN) in https://github.com/Graph-Machine-Learning-Group/grin.
